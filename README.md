# Stack Underflow DApp

A decentralized Q&A application built on **Solana** and deployed with **Next.js** on [Vercel](https://stack-underflow-psi.vercel.app/).  
Think of it as a blockchain‑powered version of Stack Overflow — users can post questions and answers, and all interactions are recorded on Solana Devnet.

## ✨ Features

- **Create Questions**: Users can submit questions with a topic and body.
- **Post Answers**: Answers are tied to questions and stored on-chain.
- **Transaction Links**: Each action returns a Solana Explorer link for transparency.
- **Live Updates**: Questions and answers are fetched from chain and displayed in real time.
- **Deployed Frontend**: Hosted on Vercel for easy access. [Access here](https://stack-underflow-psi.vercel.app/)
